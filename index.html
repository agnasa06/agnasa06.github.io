        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Arnav Gupta, a high school student with a passion for computer science, robotics, and aerospace. I am currently the co-vice president of my school's Computer Science Club, where I lead workshops and develop innovative projects, including an automated vending machine powered by Arduino. In the Robotics Club, I compete in challenges such as robot sumo wrestling and remote-controlled rescue missions. As a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol, I have trained in emergency services, earned radio certifications from FEMA, and learned about aerospace engineering while staying physically active.</p>
